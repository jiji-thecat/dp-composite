# Design Pattern - Composite Pattern

![Composite Pattern](https://github.com/jiji-thecat/dp-strategy/assets/104809324/723ad9ad-9178-4ce4-a254-ca339d495dbb)

The Composite pattern enables the representation and manipulation of recursive data structures using tree-like hierarchies.

[More details on Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_%E3%83%91%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3)

Both the `Leaf` and `Composite` classes inherit from the `Component` class. The rhombus arrow denotes aggregation, indicating that the `Component` class is part of the `Composite` class.

**Note:** This app was intended to utilize the Composite pattern, but it appears that recursive data is not currently implemented. Nevertheless, it functions as a charming app. Here's how it works:

- Press the "Add Cat" button to generate small cats that fit inside the parent doll, similar to a matryoshka doll.
- Use the "Remove" button to remove all generated cats.
